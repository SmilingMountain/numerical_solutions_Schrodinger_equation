# numerical_solutions_Schrodinger_equation

### A set of MATLAB scripts employing two methods suited to boundary value problems: numerical integration and matrix evaluation, used to solve Schrodinger's equation for a series of potentials and cases of time dependence/independence

There are relatively few analytic solutions to Schrodinger's equation so it is often necessary to seek a numerical solution in order to be able to model various quantum systems. In this project, we use two methods suited to boundary value problems, the first being numerical integration and the second being matrix evaluation. They are first employed in order to solve Schrodinger's equation for the one-dimensional infinite potential, then they are used to further study the case of a linear potential, and various situations such as the double square well (quadratic and quartic) potentials. Later in the project, time dependence for a superposition of stationary states is also studied, for the case of an ammonia molecule, using the matrix approach.

The full project report contains all the necessary background information and details, equations, methods used, results and conclussions. The MATLAB script files contain code for the various cases considered, as detailed in their descriptions, and include an appropriate level of commenting and documentation.
